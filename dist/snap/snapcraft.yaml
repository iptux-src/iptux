  iptux is an “IP Messenger” client for Linux.
  .
  It can:
    - auto-detect other clients on the intranet.
    - send message to other clients.
    - send file to other clients.
  .
  It is (supposedly) compatible with 飞鸽传书 (Feige) and 飞秋 (FeiQ)
  from China, and with the original “IP Messenger” clients from Japan
  as listed on http://ipmsg.org/ including g2ipmsg and xipmsg in Debian.
